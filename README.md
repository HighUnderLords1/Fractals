# Fractals

### By Joseph Stambaugh

This is all of the Fractal's I know.

Most of them use the Turtle class I made so if you are going to use any of these, I suggest you download my Turtle Class too.

I made these Fractals on Replit and installed graphics.py as a package so I did not have to add graphics.py into every folder.

If you want to use these locally without the graphics.py module, you might want to add graphics.py to your local PATH.
